# Bridge Risk Analysis
This analysis was originally a project I (Monika Sembiring) did with my friend Tina Feng in our 95885 - Data Science and Big Data class at Carnegie Mellon University. 

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict the conditions category of the bridges in Allegheny County, whether it is Good, Poor, or Fair, based on the bridge features and other factors that affect the bridge conditions, such as traffic and the number of crashes that happened on that bridge. With this prediction, the government can prioritize bridge inspection and maintenance for bridges with bad conditions ahead. Regarding the bridges that are still in excellent condition, the insight will encourage better preservation to maintain the sustainability of the bridges.

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
